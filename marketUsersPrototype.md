## Understand Your Users
*Write a short paragraph (50-100 words) describing the themes that emerged from the user research*

The user research suggests that many users do not have a destination in mind when planning a vacation. It appears that the website is not very user oriented as it takes many clicks to get to desired information. The destination search map appeared to be cumbersome to use for the users and was too cluttered and didn't show enough information. The users want a more streamlined website that is easier to browse and easier to find the information they are interested in.

> **🗒️ NOTE:** Make sure you share your prototype file so that "anyone with the link" can view it. If we're unable to access your file, we'll be unable to give you credit. 

*Don't forget to include a comment if you attempted any of the LevelUps, so that your grader knows to review your work and award the extra credit!* 

I added a Surprise me! button to the sweet alert. It is useful for those that don't know where they want to go and would like a little help deciding.
